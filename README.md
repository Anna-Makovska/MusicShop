## 🧠 About the Project

**MusicShop** is a fully designed and developed demo project of an online store for vinyl records and turntables, **entirely created by me** — from concept and design to frontend implementation.  
It demonstrates a realistic e-commerce experience focused on **visual quality, user experience, and clear code structure**.

Every part of this project — layout, animations, and color palette — was built to convey the atmosphere of a **premium music brand**.
